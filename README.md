This repository contains all the source code project files associated with our solution. For a more detailed understanding of the project task please see below.

Project Detail:
The designed waste management solution acts as the primary location for a user to gain an in depth understanding into the nature of IoT sensor located within the 5 aforementioned councils. Using the webpage created, a user is directed to the Microsoft Power BI dashboard. Here the user is presented with various data visualisation tools and can easily access the information they need. A number of visualisation filters further assist the user understand the IoT sensor information collected. 

Major Software Functions:
- Azure Data Brick and Data Factory to transform and prepare data for Power BI visualisation
- SQL database operation and data verification 
- Data analysis for optimising the usage of sensors data such as the bin collection route optimisation, asset tracking trajectory and water level monitoring, by linking local data source and external data sources (weather, traffic) 
- Intelligent data visualisation, professional dashboard/report design in Power BI
